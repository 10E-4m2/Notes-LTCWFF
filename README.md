# LTCWFF Notes

## Purpose

I've decided to work through this text in this way for two reasons:

1. As a refresher of Python data analysis fundamentals

2. To make a better habit of using git while working through projects



## Installation

Installation should be self-contained with the exception of data files which are part of the "Learn to Code with Fantasy Football" download

## Support

I can be reached at calvin.m.miller@gmail.com

## Roadmap

I will add additional notes until I reach the end of the text

## License

Unlicensed
